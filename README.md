British Airways Review Dataset(2012-2023)
Skytrax dataset for British airways

Summary:

Based on customer reviews between March 2016 and October 2023, British Airways (BA) received strong reviews for cabin staff service and ground service. However, the weakest area according to the reviews was the in-flight entertainment. Leisure travelers, particularly solo and couple travelers, left the most positive reviews. In almost all subgroups, entertainment was identified as the area where travelers needed the most support. Among leisure travelers, families gave the lowest average review scores. Leisure travelers, as a whole, appeared to be more satisfied with BA's service compared to business travelers. Review scores showed a downward trend from March 2016, possibly influenced by flight cancellations due to COVID-19 and a class action lawsuit against BA regarding refunds for canceled flights. Further analysis can explore correlations between aircraft types. Overall, the findings highlight areas for improvement and provide an outlook for BA's future.
